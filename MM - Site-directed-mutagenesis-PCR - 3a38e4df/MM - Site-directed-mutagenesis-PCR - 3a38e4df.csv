(_Last update: 2022.08.18_)
 

The goal of this experiment was to generate a mutagenesis library of the {ligand binding domain of the human farnesoid X receptor FXR|target sequence}. Each single residue of the LBD, which comprises residues {247-467|target residues} of the {FXRalpha2|:isoform:}, was mutated to alanine applying {site-directed mutagenesis|method}. For this, a {modified QuikChange|protocol} was applied. The wildtype FXR sequence was provided by {Dr. Jan Stindt, Klinik für Gastroenterologie, Hepatologie und Infektiologie, UKD|plasmid source} on {April 6, 2022|date of plasmid and strain receival} in {pno-Cherry|vector}.
 

{19.04.2022|date of experiment}
The PCR for generating the FXR variant {G002A|target mutation} was based on {pnoCherry::FXR alpha2 (as)|:template DNA:}. The wildtype sequence was amplified with the primers {ACCATGgcgTCAAAAATGAATCTCATTGAACATTCCC|forward primer} and {TTCATTTTTGAcgcCATGGTGGCGACCGGTGG|reverse primer}. The PCR product featured {5450|bp|product size}. The PCR mixture of {50|µL|total PCR volume} contained {0.5|μM|(primers)|PCR component} of both forward and reverse primers, {1|×|:Q5 buffer:|PCR component}, {20|ng|template DNA|PCR component}, {0.02|U/μL|Q5 polymerase|PCR component}, {0.2|mM|dNTP mix|PCR component} and {0.8|M|betaine monohydrate|PCR component}.

The success of the PCR was evaluated on a {1%|:agarose gel:}. A {5|µL|:PCR sample:} was mixed with {1|µL|:6x loading dye} and separated via {gel electrophoresis|method} at {100 V and 300 mA, (for) 30 min|electrophoresis parameters}. {GeneRuler 1 kb DNA Ladder|marker} was used as reference.
 

The PCR template was digested with {0.5|µL|:DpnI:|restriction enzyme} per 50 µL PCR for {1 h at 37 °C|incubation}.
 

The digested PCR was purified applying the {Macherey-Nagel|:PCR purification kit:}. The purified DNA was eluted with {30|µL|:H2O:|elution volume} after {1 min at 70°C|incubation}. The DNA concentration was measured with an {Implen N60 Nanophotometer|device}. The purified PCR mix contained {272.2|ng/µL|:DNA:|concentration} and was diluted with H2O for further use to {87.7|ng/µL|DNA|dilution}.
