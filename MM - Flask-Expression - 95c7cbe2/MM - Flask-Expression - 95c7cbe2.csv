After cloning or receiving a new strain, flask expression is conducted with the aim to generate an active enzyme or folded protein.
 

{29.09.2017|Date of experiment}
Overnight precultures of {P. putida KT2440 pVLT33::pigC|expression strain} and the {empty vector strain (:as:)|:negative control:} are grown from a {single colony|inoculum} in {5|mL|:LB Kan:|growth media} at {30|°C|temperature} and {250|rpm|shaking} {overnight|time}.
 

{10.10.2017|Date of experiment}
Two {100|mL|:LB Kan:|expression media} cultures in {unbaffled Erlenmeyer|:flasks:} per strain were inoculated to an OD600 of {0.05|inoculation OD} with the overnight cultures.

P. putida KT2440 pVLT33 (EV)


7.92


0.05 / 7.92 * 100 mL = 0.631 mL




The cultures were incubated at {30|°C|temperature} and {250|rpm|shaking} to an OD600 of {0.4-0.6|induction OD} and induced by addition of {0.5|mM|:isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG):|inducer molecule}. {4|h|:after induction:|time of substrate supplementation}, the cultures were supplemented with {0.5|mM|:MAP and MBC:|substrates} in order to confirm the presence of active PigC enzyme.
During and after induction, samples of the corresponding volume of {1|mL|:OD = 1:|sample volume} were taken at {1|h|:intervals:} for SDS-PAGE analysis. Samples were pelleted for {1|min|centrifugation time} at {11,000|xg|centrifugation speed} and stored at {-20|°C|storage temperature}.

{25.10.2017|Date of experiment}
Samples from the expression cultures were thawn on ice and resuspended in {30|µL|:PBS buffer:|resuspension volume}. After {1|min|:sonification:} in an ultrasonic bath, resuspended samples were mixed with {10|µL|:4x SDS loading dye:}, incubated for {5 min at 95°C|incubation} and {vortex(:ed:) thoroughly|process} in order to shear genomic DNA. The boiled samples were spinned down for {1 min at maximal speed|centrifugation} and {5|µL|(:of:) :supernatant:} was loaded on a {10|%|:SDS-PAGE separating gel:|acrylamide concentration}.
